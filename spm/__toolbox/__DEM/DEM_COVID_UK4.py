        Demonstration of COVID-19 modelling using variational Laplace (4 groups)
       __________________________________________________________________________
        This routine illustrates the dynamic causal modelling of the epidemic in
        the United Kingdom using four age groups that are coupled via (prevalence
        -dependent) contact rates. It is the routine used to prepare the graphics
        and report for the DCM COVID dashboard.
