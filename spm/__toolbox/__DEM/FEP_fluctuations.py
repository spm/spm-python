      This demonstration  uses an ensemble of particles with intrinsic (Lorentz  
        attractor) dynamics and (Newtonian) short-range coupling.  The focus of  
        this routine is to unpack the Bayesian perspective. We first simulate  
        dynamics  to nonequilibrium steady-state, identify the Markov blanket and  
        then examine the encoding of external states by internal states; in terms  
        of their expected values.  
         
        The crucial aspect of this implicit inference (and the basis of the free  
        energy principle) is the existence of a conditional synchronisation  
        manifold, when conditioning internal and external states on the Markov  
        blanket. This provides the basis for a mapping between internal and  
        external states that can be interpreted in terms of a probabilistic  
        representation or inference.  
         
        This Bayesian perspective is illustrated in terms of a mapping between  
        the canonical modes of internal and external states (as approximated  
        with a polynomial expansion). The canonical modes her are evaluated  
        using an estimate of the conditional expectations  based upon the  
        Euclidean proximity of Markov blanket states. The ensuing posterior over  
        external states is than illustrated, in relation to the actual external  
        states. We also  simulate event related potentials by identifying  
        several points in time when the Markov blankets revisit the same  
        neighbourhood. Finally, to illustrate the underlying dynamics, the  
        Jacobians or coupling among internal and external states are  
        presented; using different orders of coupling (i.e., degrees of  
        separation)
