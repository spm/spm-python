      This simulation uses a Markov Decision process formulation of active
        inference to demonstrate the interaction between interoceptive and
        exteroceptive perception. This relies upon the fact that the function of
        exteroceptive sense organs depends upon oscillatory cycles in
        interoceptive states. The example used here is the change in retinal
        blood flow, and its influence on vision, during a cardiac cycle.
