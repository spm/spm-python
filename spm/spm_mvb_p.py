      Classical p-value for MVB using null distribution of log-odds ratio

        MVB - Multivariate Bayes structure
        k   - number of samples > 20

        p   - p-value: of (relative) F using an empirical null distribution

        spm_mvb_p evaluates an empirical null distribution for the (fee-energy)
        difference in log-evidences (the log odds ratio) by phase-shuffling the
        target vector and repeating the greedy search. It adds the p-value as a
        field (p_value) to MVB.
