      FT_TRIALFUN_GUI reads events from the dataset, displays a graphical user interface
        dialog to select the event types and values of interest, and constructs a trial
        definition. This function should in general not be called directly, it will be
        called by FT_DEFINETRIAL.

        Use this function by calling
          [cfg] = ft_definetrial(cfg)
        where the configuration structure should contain
          cfg.dataset   = string with the filename
          cfg.trialfun  = 'ft_trialfun_gui'
