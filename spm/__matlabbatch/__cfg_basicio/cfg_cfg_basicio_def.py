      'BasicIO' - MATLABBATCH defaults  
        This MATLABBATCH defaults file has been generated automatically  
        by MATLABBATCH using ConfGUI. It contains all pre-defined values for  
        menu items and provides a full documentation of all fields that may  
        be present in a job variable for this application.  
        Changes to this file will be overwritten if the ConfGUI batch is executed again.
